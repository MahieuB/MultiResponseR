This package implements the multiple-response chi-square framework introduced in Mahieu, Schlich, Visalli, and Cardot (2020) for the analysis of contingency data obtained from multiple-response questionnaires. The multiple-response framework notably includes a multiple-response chi-square test and a multiple-response correspondence analysis. Two types of cases are distinguished: a general case where one subject contributes only to one category and the particular case of sensory data (notably Check-All-That-Apply and Free-Comment) where one subject contributes to several categories (products).
