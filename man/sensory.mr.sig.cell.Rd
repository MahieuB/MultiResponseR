\usage{
sensory.mr.sig.cell(
  data,
  nsample = 2000,
  nbaxes.sig = Inf,
  two.sided = FALSE,
  ncores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame of evaluations in rows whose first two columns are factors (subject and product) and subsequent columns are binary numeric or integer, each column being a descriptor}

\item{nsample}{Number of randomly sampled datasets to estimate the distribution of the value under the null hypothesis. See details}

\item{nbaxes.sig}{The number of significant axes retuned by \code{\link[MultiResponseR]{sensory.mr.dimensionality.test}}. By default, all axes are considered significant. See details}

\item{two.sided}{Logical. Should the tests be two-sided or not? By default, the tests are performed with a one-sided greater alternative hypothesis}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores used to estimate the null distribution. Default is 2. See details}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{original.cont}{Observed number of times each product was described by each descriptor}
\item{percent.cont}{For each product, percentage of evaluations where each descriptor was cited for this product}
\item{null.cont}{Expected number of times each product was described by each descriptor under the null hypothesis}
\item{p.values}{P-values of the tests per cell}
\item{derived.cont}{The derived contingency table corresponding to \emph{nbaxes.sig} axes}
\item{percent.derived.cont}{For each product, percentage of evaluations where each descriptor was cited for this product in the derived contingency table corresponding to \emph{nbaxes.sig} axes}
}
}
\description{
This function performs the tests per cell as defined in Mahieu, Schlich, Visalli, and Cardot (2020) using random hypergeometric samplings to estimate the null distribution. For each cell, a test is performed to investigate if the observed value significantly differs from the expected value under the null hypothesis of no associations between products and descriptors. The test performed for each cell results of the adaptation of the chi-square per cell test described in Symoneaux, Galmarini, and Mehinagic (2012) from the usual chi-square framework to the modified chi-square framework introduced in Loughin and Scherer (1998). The difference with \code{\link[MultiResponseR]{mr.sig.cell}} is that random hypergeometric samplings are performed taking into account the subject structure of sensory data in \code{\link[MultiResponseR]{sensory.mr.sig.cell}}

\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{nsample}: The distribution of the value under the null hypothesis of no associations between products and descriptors is estimated using \emph{nsample} datasets generated thanks to random hypergeometric samplings of the response vectors along products within subjects.
\item \strong{nbaxes.sig}: If \emph{nbaxes.sig} is lower than the total number of axes then the tests are performed on the derived contingency table corresponding to significant axes (Mahieu, Visalli, & Schlich, 2020; Mahieu, Schlich, Visalli, & Cardot, 2020) This table is obtained by reversing mrCA computations on the first \emph{nbaxes.sig} axes.
\item \strong{ncores}: The more cores are added in the process, the faster the results will be obtained. The number of available cores is accessible using \code{\link[parallel]{detectCores}}. The parallel tasks are closed once the \emph{nsample} datasets are generated.
